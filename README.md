a project on immersive installation with the topic of fantasy
Most people are focusing on how fantasy are doing more harm than good to one's mind and life. But here I want to focus on the good side of fantasizing. In my opinion, one's fantasies could actually help in achieving goals in life. Fantasizing our goals could help us to motivate ourselvess in achieving it in our future. Of course what we fantasize will not happen exactly in reality but we will/might reach to our desired destination. Fantasizing also could help one's mind as a therapy. It can rejuvenates one's mind to be positive and helps to make a decision. But, first of all, we need to learn what does fantasy means.

The word Fantasy was originated in the Greek word, ‘phantasia,’ which literally means “to make visible.” According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, fantasy means the power or process of creating especially unrealistic or improbable mental images in response to psychological need. (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fantasy) Meanwhile, the clinical summation of the word “Phantasy (or Fantasy),” as noted The Language of Psycho-Analysis, is “an imaginary scene in which the subject is a protagonist, representing the fulfillment of a wish (in the last analysis, an unconscious wish) in a manner that is distorted to a greater or lesser extent by defensive processes”. (The Language of Psycho-Analysis, 314). This definition is situated in the investigation of Freud's work. Freud's compositions bolster the utilization of the term fantasy in bringing out a refinement amongst creative ability and reality (or observation). This axis of reference forces one to consider fantasy as an illusory production which cannot be “sustained when it is confronted with a correct apprehension of reality.”

Freud presents the internal world, one which tends towards satisfaction by means of illusion, against the outside world, which is understood as the reality, or mediation of the perceptual. Freud suggests in The Interpretation of Dreams that certain unconscious fantasies are related to unconscious wishes. Fantasy, therefore for Freud, presents a unique focal point where it is possible to observe the transition, or mediation, between “the different psychical systems in vitro – to observe the mechanism or repression, or of the return of the repressed in action” (317). The duality of fantasy is hence perceived as both composed, cognizant musings of creative ability or of oblivious idea.
